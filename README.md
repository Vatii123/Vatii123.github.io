# Vatii123.github.io
### A weird website that is created by Vatii123 with HTML and CSS!

## Tools

- Visual Studio Code : A coding IDE used during the making.
- Atom : A coding IDE used during the making.
- HTML : One of the two language used in creation of the website.
- CSS : One of the two languages used in creation of the website.

## Why I make this website

- I have been improving my HTML and learning CSS and i think that the old website looks cool and all but I need something that I look and think that "Oh wow, that website looks pretty good."
- The old website had some mistake that I have made such as when I click the link it would change colors which can be easily fix but i think that i would fix it in the new website.

## Special Thanks

- My family for being so supportive of what I am doing.
- My friend group for rating my website. (RIP SS)
- codecademy and freecodecamp for teaching me HTML and CSS.
- Youtube and Google for teaching me how to even write any code.

## To-do List / Things that I might fix.

- Remade all the version of website in old website (nisayanmode, nawee and something)
- Made the Projects and Information website.
